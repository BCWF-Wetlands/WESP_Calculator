# WESP_Calculator
R code to interact with excel based WESP calculator

============================

The B.C. Wildlife Federationâ€™s Wetlands Workforce project is a collaboration with conservation organizations and First Nations working to maintain and monitor wetlands across British Columbia. https://bcwf.bc.ca/initiatives/wetlands-workforce/.  

WESP - Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol   

### Data

The input excel WESP Spreadsheet requires some minor formatting changes to be machine readable.   
1. Remove bottom row referencing site ids.   
2. Adding a column indicating question and sub-questions, for example the row describing OF32 becomes OF32_0 and the individual OF32 questions become OF32_1, OF32_2 and OF32_3.   
3. The first row, specifically the "F" and "S" sheets are modified so that every column has a heading.
    
### Usage

There are a set of scripts that help load data from WESP Calculator excel spreadsheet and from the Survey 123 WESP protocol applicationn there are four basic sets of scripts:    
Control scripts - set up the analysis environment;   
Load scripts - loads excel and survey 123 data;   
Clean scripts - cleans loaded data and generates a single EcoProvince data set;   
Output scripts - outputs collated data.

#Control Scripts:   
run_all.R	Sets local variables and directories used by scripts, presents script order.  
header.R	loads R packages, sets global directories, and attributes.

#Load Scripts:	
Load_BatchCalculator.R  
Clean_BatchCalculator_Field.R 
Clean_BatchCalculator_Office.R  
Clean_BatchCalculator_Stressor.R  

#Loading and cleaning Survey 123
Load_Survey123.R  
Clean_Survey123_Function.R  
Clean_Survey123_Stressor.R

#Output   
Output_WESP_Data.R 

### Project Status

The scripts are continually being modified and improved.
